# EasySPAN
smartphone ad-hoc networking

This is the working package of the bachelor project of Jesper Findahl, studying at USI, Lugano (CH).

Easy SPAN is an Android framework that enables smartphones to communicate without using any network infrastructure besides the smartphones. It is demonstrated by a chat application that has a public chat and a direct (peer-to-peer) chat. The project was created in [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html).

**To install & run the app:**
- download [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html)
- open the project (File -> Open...)
- connect smartphones
- run the app
- to chat: 
  - create a group on one device (settings), and discover with the others
  - accept connection if asked
  - once connected the send button is enabled and you can now chat!
